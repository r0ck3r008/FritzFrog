## type struct DHGroup
This is quite likely used to exchange keys within the peers

1. main.*DHGroup.ComputeKey __0x007ee470__
2. main.*DHGroup.G __0x007edcf0__

## type struct Database
This type most likely is used to store peer information, data fetched, blacklisted peers as well as peers currently being deployed
Following are notable methods:
1. main.NewDatabase __0x007d4290__
	- Creates a new instance of _Database_ type, idiomatic Go.
2. main.*Database.AddBlEntry __0x007d5890__
	- Inserts a new blacklist entry
	- Internally uses _main.*Database.internalAddBlEntry_ @__0x007d5660__
3. main.*Database.AddDeploying __0x007d500__
	- Possibly inserts a new entry which is currently being deployed and compromised for insertion into the swarm
	- Internally calls a _main.*Database.internalAddDeploying_ @__0x007d6620__
4. main.*Database.AddOwned __0x007d8800__
	- Possibly inerts the information about binary data/blobs into the database
	- Internally uses _main.*Database.internalAddOwned_ @__0x007d7640__
5. main.*Database.AddTarget __0x007d5970__
	- Adds a new target that might possibly convert to a deployed peer (?)
	- Internally uses _main.*Database.internalAddTarget_ @__0x007d4f80__
6. main.*Database.AddTPEntry __0x007d7000__
	- Adds a _target pool_ which most likely consists a swarm of targets
	- Internally leverages _main.*Database.internalAddTPEntry_ @__0x007d7130__
	- Interestingly, it does not leverage _main.*Database.internalAddTarget_ in a loop indicating a deviation of _Target Pool_ from a single target
7. main.*Database.GetBlacklist __0x007d4ac0__
8. main.*Database.GetDeploying __0x007d4850__
9. main.*Database.GetOwned __0x007d45e0__

13. main.*Database.IncreaseFailCount __0x007d5f40__
14. main.*Database.IncreaseTryCount __0x007d8940__
15. main.*Database.RemoveDeploying __0x007d5e10__
16. main.*Database.RemoveOwned __0x007d5cd0__
17. main.*Database.RemoveTarget __0x007d5a60__
18. main.*Database.ResetDeployFailCount __0x007d63c0__
19. main.*Database.ResetSuccFails __0x007d90e0__

## main.Worker
main.Worker is presumably a function that is run after key exchange is successful.
If this is the case, then it is very likely it is run as a separate go routine.
It basically is an infinite if-else loop with separate functions called as commands.
